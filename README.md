# Bury the Hatchet

Bury the Hatchet is the ultimate civil discussion platform, for
fact-checked conversation and evidence-supported claims. Just like
other discussion sites, users can create posts and contribute to
discussion, but they must link in verified data sources to support
their claim.

This may sound like an annoying task, but this data linking is
done seamlessly and almost automatically using natural language
processing. Post are continuously processed through keyword
extraction to find relevant data from our database of valid
sources. Pieces of evidence, called "facts", are recommended as
you type, and can be linked into relevant regions of your argument.

When all is said and done, an NLP algorithm related to extractive
summarization is used to create a succinct list of arguments from
the discussion, giving readers a solid overview of the discussion
and evidence used throughout.

##  Android Application

This Android application was built using Kotlin, a newer JVM-based
programming language with increasing Android support. It features
a home screen for viewing all topics, and a submission page which
automatically pulls data from news sources as you type your post.
